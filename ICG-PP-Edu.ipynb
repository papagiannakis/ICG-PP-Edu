    "## Course description\n",
    "The aim of this advanced computer graphics course is to explore the algorithms and methods used for modern interactive graphics: when computerized images need to be displayed at many frames per second utilizing hardware acceleration. The focus is to introduce students to state-of-the-art graphics technology (GPU programming) and latest techniques for modeling, rendering and animation that enable interactive applications like game engines and real-time 3D simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Modern Interactive Computer Graphics is a dynamic field of study dedicated to the generation, manipulation, and representation of visual images using computers and mathematical models. It encompasses a wide range of topics such as real-time rendering, simulation of natural phenomena, geometric modeling, digital animation, as well as the use of deep learning and neural rendering / modeling. Leveraging advances in hardware (e.g., GPU), computational techniques, and neural networks, research in this domain aims to create visually compelling, immersive experiences, simulate the physical world with high fidelity, and develop intuitive interfaces. As a cornerstone of the digital media industry, computer graphics continue to push the boundaries of visual storytelling, virtual and extended reality, spatial computing and interactive design.\n",
